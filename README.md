# Timeseries-forecasting-of-Crimes-in-Boston
I build a Timeseries Model that Forecasts daily crime rates during using SARIMAX model
 The model could be trained on different data specific to geographical location and type of offence that will result in forecasting the chances of major crimes in specific locations

I also analysed and visualized Boston Crimes Dataset
I was able to answer following questions
INCIDENT_NUMBER a unique column?
What types of crimes are most common?
Which District and UCR has highest crime rate?
Where are different types of crimes most likely to occur?
Does the frequency of crimes change over the day? Week? Year?
Analysing the occurance of top 5 crimes based on Weekday!
Forecasting the daily frequency of crimes!

I was able to draw following insights
Majority of cases are of Motor Vehicle Accident
Over the past year cases on Larceny and Drug voilation has increased a lot while Cases on Medical Assistance has lowered.
Districts like B2, C11, D4 has high crime rate
Most cases of Motor Vehicle Accident happened in B2 & C11 Districts
Most cases of Larceny happened in D4 District
During summer crime rate increases
During Weekends crime rate decreases
During Evening crime rate increses especially during 4-6 P.M
There are plots that suggest occurance of Major crime during weekdays


**I have also used gtts (Google Text To Speech) library for hearing the objective and results  of the project**
